# Student Performance Analysis 
 
## Overview 
 
This project focuses on detailed statistical and probabilistic analysis of student performance data. 
 
## Analysis Details 
 
### Basic Statistical Analysis 
 
- Calculated mean and standard deviation for Math, Reading, and Writing scores. 
 
### Probabilities 
 
- Calculated the probability that a student is Male or has a Math Score above 80. 
- Applied Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability of being Male given a Math Score above 80. 
 
### Normal Distribution 
 
- Checked normality of Math Scores using QQ plots, histograms, and Shapiro-Wilk test. 
 
### Z-Score and Noise Removal 
 
- Computed z-scores for Math Scores and filtered out outliers beyond 95%. 
 
### Visualizations 
 
- Created various plots (box, histogram, scatter, pie) to visualize Math Scores before and after noise removal. 
 
### Hypothesis Testing 
 
- Performed two-sample hypothesis test for Math Scores between Male and Female students. 
- Conducted ANOVA to compare Math Scores across different ethnicities. 
 
### Confidence Interval 
 
- Calculated a 95% confidence interval for the mean Math Score.
